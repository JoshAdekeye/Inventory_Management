# Building a Serverless Architecture on AWS: Step-by-Step Guide

## Introduction  
This guide outlines how to design and deploy a serverless architecture using AWS, enabling scalable and event-driven automation without managing underlying servers.

## Step-by-Step Setup

### 1. Provision an S3 Bucket  
Begin by creating an Amazon S3 bucket to serve as the storage location for incoming data files.

### 2. Set Up a DynamoDB Table  
Deploy a DynamoDB table to maintain structured inventory records.

### 3. Configure an SNS Topic  
Establish an Amazon SNS (Simple Notification Service) topic for broadcasting alerts or updates, particularly for low inventory scenarios.

### 4. Assign IAM Roles to Lambda Functions  
Create and assign IAM roles that allow Lambda functions to interact securely with S3, DynamoDB, and SNS services.

### 5. Develop Lambda Functions  
Build AWS Lambda functions to perform the following tasks:
- Ingest and parse files from the S3 bucket
- Update records in the DynamoDB table
- Send notifications via SNS when specific thresholds (e.g., low stock) are met

## Testing the Workflow

### 1. Upload a Test CSV File  
Place a sample CSV file containing `store`, `product`, and `count` columns into the S3 bucket.

### 2. Validate the Pipeline  
Confirm that the Lambda functions:
- Successfully parse and read the CSV content
- Accurately update the DynamoDB inventory records
- Trigger SNS notifications for relevant conditions such as low stock levels

## Resource Clean-Up

### 1. Remove Deployed Components  
After testing, delete the created resources, including the CSV file, S3 bucket, DynamoDB table, SNS topic, Lambda functions, and IAM roles to avoid incurring charges.

## Automating Deployment with CloudFormation

You can encapsulate the entire infrastructure in an AWS CloudFormation template, enabling you to provision all resources in one click for consistent and repeatable deployments.

## Conclusion

Adopting serverless architecture on AWS simplifies infrastructure management and enhances operational efficiency. Services like S3, DynamoDB, SNS, and Lambda allow you to build responsive, scalable applications that dynamically react to events. This architecture is especially suited for scenarios like inventory tracking, where real-time processing and automation are crucial.
